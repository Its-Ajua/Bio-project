            <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of technology and coding, I have a passion for the arts and literature. I enjoy watching a wide variety of movies and series. Reading is another one of my hobbies and i often find myself lost in the pages of captivating books, especially mystery books. Problem-solving is a facination of mine, which aligns with my pursuit of a career in technology. I'm also an enthusiast of drawing and fashion. My creative nature drives me to transform blank pages into beautiful creations with just a pencil.

            <h3>Why I joined AltSchool</h3>
            <p>I vividly recall getting an email offering me a 50% discount as a member of the Nigerian Association of Computing Students in Nigeria (NACOS). The opportunity excited me, and without hesitation, I registered. Witnessing numerous success stories on social media inspired me to strive to be a trailblazer at AltSchool.  I've long aspired to a career in technology, and AltSchool provided the guidance I needed as a newcomer to this field. Joining AltSchool stands as one of my most significant achievements this year, and I'm excited about the invaluable skills I will acquire upon program completion. It's an opportunity I believe no one should miss. Becoming an altschooler has changed my mindset on a lot of things, I joined altschool to become a backend engineer and imagine my surprise when I found out that i had to do html, css and javascript in my first semester, I'm still on the journey in my first semester and all i can say is that it has been a wonderful experience. I am able to do things I had absolutely no knowledge of how they work before.
